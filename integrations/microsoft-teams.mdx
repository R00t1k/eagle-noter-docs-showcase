## Overview

Eagle Noter supports Microsoft Teams meetings, including both personal and organizational Teams calls. Our bot joins as a guest participant to record, transcribe, and summarize your meetings.

## How to Join a Teams Meeting

### Instant Join

Join any Teams meeting instantly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the Meeting Link">
    Get the Teams meeting URL from your calendar invite or Teams app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Instant Join">
    Open the **Instant Join** tab in your Eagle Noter dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste and Join">
    Paste the URL and click **Join Meeting**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admit the Bot">
    The meeting host needs to admit the bot from the lobby
  </Step>
</Steps>

### From Your Calendar

If your Google Calendar contains Teams meeting links:

1. Go to the **Calendars** tab
2. Find your meeting with a Teams link
3. Click **Invite Bot**
4. The bot will join when the meeting starts

## Admitting the Bot

<Warning>
For most Teams meetings, the bot joins as a guest and must be **admitted from the lobby** by the meeting organizer.
</Warning>

When the bot tries to join:

1. The host sees a notification that someone is waiting in the lobby
2. The host clicks **Admit** to let the bot in
3. The bot starts recording immediately

## Organizational Settings

Depending on your organization's Microsoft 365 settings, additional configuration may be needed:

| Setting | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Guest Access** | Must be enabled for external participants |
| **Lobby Settings** | Controls who waits in lobby |
| **Recording Policy** | May affect bot capabilities |

<Note>
If you're having trouble with the bot joining organizational Teams meetings, contact your IT administrator to verify guest access is enabled.
