## Admitting the Bot

<Warning>
Google Meet requires a participant to **admit** the bot from the waiting room. The bot cannot join automatically.
</Warning>

When the bot tries to join:

1. A notification appears: *"Eagle Noter wants to join this call"*
2. Click **Admit** to let the bot in
3. The bot will start recording immediately

<Tip>
If you're the meeting organizer, watch for the "Someone wants to join" notification at the bottom of your screen.
