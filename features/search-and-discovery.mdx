## Search Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Specific Keywords">
    Instead of searching "project update", try "Q4 budget review" or the specific project name for more relevant results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Search for Speakers">
    Looking for what someone said? Search for their name along with the topic: "John budget" will find discussions where John talked about the budget.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Search Phrases">
    Put phrases in quotes for exact matches: "action items" will find that exact phrase rather than "action" and "items" separately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Filter by Date">
    Narrow down results by using the date filters to search within a specific time period.
  </Accordion>
