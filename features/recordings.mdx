## Tips for Best Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Audio Quality">
    Clear audio with minimal background noise produces the best transcriptions. If possible, use recordings from dedicated microphones rather than laptop speakers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Speaker Clarity">
    Ensure speakers don't talk over each other. Clear turn-taking helps with accurate transcription and speaker identification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File Size">
    For very long recordings (over 2 hours), consider splitting them into smaller segments for faster processing.
