## Tips for Better Transcription

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Good Microphones">
    Clear audio produces better transcriptions. Use headsets or dedicated microphones when possible, rather than laptop speakers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reduce Background Noise">
    Find a quiet space for your meetings. Background noise can interfere with transcription accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Speak Clearly">
    Speak at a normal pace and avoid mumbling. Clear speech helps the AI understand you better.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Overlapping Speech">
    When multiple people talk at once, transcription accuracy decreases. Try to take turns speaking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Language">
    Set your transcription language in **Options** to match the primary language of your meetings.
