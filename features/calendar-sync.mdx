## Overview

Connecting your calendar is the most powerful way to use Eagle Noter. Once connected, all your upcoming meetings with Google Meet or Microsoft Teams links will appear in your dashboard, ready for the bot to join with a single click.

## Supported Calendars

Eagle Noter supports both major calendar providers:

- **Google Calendar** (Gmail, Google Workspace accounts)
- **Microsoft Calendar** (Outlook, Microsoft 365, Exchange)

  <Step title="Choose Your Calendar Provider">
    You'll see options for:
    - **Google Calendar** - Click to connect your Google account
    - **Microsoft Calendar** - Click to connect your Outlook/Microsoft 365 account

## What We Access

For your privacy, Eagle Noter only reads:
- **Event time** - When the meeting starts and ends
- **Event title** - The name of the meeting
- **Meeting link** - Google Meet or Teams URLs in the event

<Warning>
We do not read or store the content of your private appointments, attendee lists, or any other sensitive calendar data.
</Warning>

## Joining Calendar Meetings

Once your calendar is connected:

1. Go to the **Calendars** tab in your dashboard
2. Find your upcoming meeting in the list
3. Click the **Invite Bot** button next to the event
4. The bot will be scheduled to join that specific meeting

<Tip>
The bot joins approximately 1 minute before the scheduled start time to ensure it doesn't miss any content.
</Tip>

## Meeting Detection

Eagle Noter automatically detects meeting links in your calendar events:

| Platform | Detection |
|----------|-----------|
| Google Meet | ✅ Automatically detected |
| Microsoft Teams | ✅ Automatically detected |

Events without a recognized meeting link will not show the "Invite Bot" option.

## Auto-Join Settings

You can configure automatic bot joining behavior in your workspace **Options**:

- **Default behavior**: Manual invite required for each meeting
- **Bot display name**: Customize how the bot appears in meetings

## Disconnecting Your Calendar

To disconnect a calendar:

1. Go to the **Calendars** tab in your workspace
2. Find the calendar you want to disconnect
3. Click the **Disconnect** button next to it

<Note>
Disconnecting a calendar will remove it from your dashboard. You can reconnect at any time.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My meetings aren't showing up">
    Make sure your calendar is properly connected. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your Google account. Also ensure your meetings have a valid Google Meet or Teams link.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The bot didn't join my meeting">
    Check that the meeting link is valid and accessible. For Google Meet, ensure the meeting has started. For Teams, make sure the organizer has enabled guest access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I see duplicate meetings">
    This can happen if you have multiple calendars. Eagle Noter pulls from your primary calendar by default.
  </Accordion>
