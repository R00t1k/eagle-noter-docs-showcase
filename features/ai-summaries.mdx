## Overview

After every meeting, Eagle Noter automatically generates an AI-powered summary that captures the key points, decisions made, and action items. No more manual note-taking or missing important details.

## What's Included in a Summary

## How It Works

1. **Meeting ends** - The bot leaves and processing begins
2. **Transcript analyzed** - AI reads through the full transcript
3. **Summary generated** - Key information is extracted and organized
4. **Email sent** - You receive the summary in your inbox (if enabled)
5. **Available in dashboard** - View the full summary anytime

<Note>
Summary generation typically takes 1-2 minutes after the meeting ends.
</Note>

## Summary Languages

You can configure which language your AI summaries are generated in. Go to **Options** in your workspace:

| Language | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Auto | Automatically matches the transcript language |
| English | Summaries always in English |
| German | Summaries always in German |
| French | Summaries always in French |
| Spanish | Summaries always in Spanish |
| Italian | Summaries always in Italian |
| Portuguese | Summaries always in Portuguese |

<Tip>
Using "Auto" will detect the language from your transcript and generate the summary in that language.
