## Bot Not Joining My Meeting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The bot isn't joining">
    **Try these steps:**
    - Make sure the meeting has started (at least one person must be in it)
    - Check that the meeting link is correct and complete
    - Verify you're using a supported platform (Google Meet or Microsoft Teams)
    - Try using **Instant Join** to manually send the bot
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bot stuck in waiting room">
    **Solution:** The meeting host needs to admit the bot.
    
    - For **Google Meet**: Look for "Someone wants to join" notification and click **Admit**
    - For **Microsoft Teams**: Check the lobby and click **Admit** next to the bot
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bot was removed from the meeting">
    **Possible causes:**
    - The host may have kicked the bot
    - Meeting security settings may block guests
    - For Teams, guest access may be disabled
    
    **Solution:** Ask the meeting host to allow the bot to join, or try rejoining with Instant Join.
