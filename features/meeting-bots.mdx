## Overview

Eagle Noter's meeting bots automatically join your Google Meet and Microsoft Teams meetings to record, transcribe, and generate AI summaries. The bot acts as a participant in your meeting, capturing everything that's said.

## How the Bot Works

### Bot Lifecycle

When you invite the bot to a meeting, here's what happens:

| Stage | What Happens | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Scheduled** | Bot is waiting to join | Until meeting time |
| **Joining** | Bot connects to the meeting | ~10-30 seconds |
| **Recording** | Bot captures audio and transcribes | Meeting duration |
| **Leaving** | Bot disconnects from the meeting | ~5 seconds |
| **Processing** | AI generates summary and insights | 1-2 minutes |

### Two Ways to Use the Bot

#### 1. From Your Calendar

1. Connect your Google Calendar in the **Calendars** tab
2. Find your upcoming meeting with a Google Meet or Teams link
3. Click **Invite Bot** next to the meeting
4. The bot will join automatically when the meeting starts

#### 2. Instant Join

1. Go to the **Instant Join** tab
2. Paste any Google Meet or Teams meeting link
3. Click **Join Meeting**
4. The bot joins immediately

## What the Bot Does

During your meeting, the bot:

- **Records audio** in high quality
- **Transcribes speech** in real-time 
- **Identifies speakers** when possible
- **Detects the language** being spoken

After the meeting:

- **Generates AI summary** with key points
- **Extracts action items** and decisions
- **Makes everything searchable** across your workspace
- **Sends email notifications** if configured

## Bot Appearance

The bot appears as a participant in your meeting with a customizable display name. You can set the bot's name in your workspace **Options**.

<Tip>
Use a clear name like "Eagle Noter Bot" or "[Your Company] Meeting Notes" so participants know why the bot is in the meeting.
</Tip>

## Managing Active Bots

### During a Meeting

While the bot is active in a meeting, you can:
- **View live transcription** as it happens
- **See bot status** (connecting, recording, etc.)
- **Kick the bot** if you need to stop recording

### After a Meeting

Once the meeting ends:
- The bot automatically leaves
- Processing begins for AI summary generation
- You'll receive an email with the summary (if enabled)
- Full transcript and recording are available in your dashboard

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inform Participants">
    Let meeting participants know the bot is recording. The bot's presence is visible to all participants.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clear Audio">
    Better audio quality means better transcriptions. Use good microphones and minimize background noise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One Speaker at a Time">
    When speakers talk over each other, transcription accuracy decreases. Encourage turn-taking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Admit the Bot">
    If you're the meeting host, be ready to admit the bot from the waiting room or lobby.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
