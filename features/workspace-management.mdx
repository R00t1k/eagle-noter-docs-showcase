## Overview

The **Options** page lets you configure how Eagle Noter works for your workspace. Access it by clicking **Options** in the sidebar.

## Agent Timeout

Control when the bot automatically leaves idle meetings.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **No one joined timeout** | How many minutes the bot waits if nobody joins the meeting | 10 minutes |
| **Everyone left timeout** | How many minutes the bot waits after everyone leaves before it also leaves | 5 minutes |

<Tip>
Enable **Leave automatically when idle** to have the bot exit meetings when no one is present, saving resources.
</Tip>

## Transcriber

Configure the default transcription language used by the bot during meetings.

### Transcription Language Options

| Language | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Auto (Multilingual)** | Automatically detects the spoken language |
| **English** | Optimized for English |
| **German/Swiss German** | Optimized for German and Swiss German dialects |
| **French** | Optimized for French |

<Note>
Choose the language that best matches what will be spoken in your meetings. Use "Auto" if you're unsure or if meetings include multiple languages.
</Note>

## AI Summary Language

Choose the language for AI-generated meeting summaries and emails.

### Summary Language Options

| Language | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Auto** | Automatically detected from the meeting transcript |
| **English** | Summaries always in English |
| **German** | Summaries always in German |
| **French** | Summaries always in French |
| **Spanish** | Summaries always in Spanish |
| **Italian** | Summaries always in Italian |
| **Portuguese** | Summaries always in Portuguese |

<Note>
When set to "Auto", the summary language will be automatically detected from the meeting transcript. Otherwise, summaries will always be generated in your selected language.
</Note>

## Email Notifications

Configure CC email addresses for meeting summaries.

### How It Works

After each meeting, Eagle Noter sends an email summary. You can add additional email addresses to receive copies:

1. Go to **Options**
2. Find the **Email Notifications** section
3. Click **+ Add Email Address**
4. Enter the email address
5. Click **Save**

All email addresses you add will be CC'd on all meeting summary emails.

<Tip>
Add your team members' email addresses so everyone gets the meeting summary automatically.
</Tip>

## Saving Changes

After making any changes to your options, click the **Save** button in the top right corner to apply them.

## Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize your meetings and collaborate with your team.

### Creating a Workspace

When you first sign up, you'll be prompted to create a workspace. You can also create additional workspaces later:

1. Click on your workspace name in the sidebar
2. Select **Create New Workspace**
3. Give it a name and customize settings

### Switching Workspaces

If you belong to multiple workspaces:

1. Click your workspace name in the sidebar
2. Select the workspace you want to switch to
3. Your dashboard will update to show that workspace's content

### Shared Resources

Within a workspace:
- All meetings are visible to workspace members
- Transcripts and summaries are shared
- Search works across all workspace content
- Email notifications can include the whole team

<Tip>
Create separate workspaces for different clients or projects to keep meeting content organized.
